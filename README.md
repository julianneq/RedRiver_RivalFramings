# RedRiver_RivalFramings

This repository contains the code and results used to generate Figures 1-8 and S1-S2 of the following paper:

Quinn, J.D., Reed, P.M., Giuliani, M., and Castelletti, A. (2017). Rival framings: a framework for discovering how problem formulation uncertainties shape risk management tradeoffs in water resources systems. Water Resources Research, 53(8), 7208-7233. https://doi.org/10.1002/2017WR020524

Generating Figures S3-S5 requires reading in governmental data on streamflow in the basin. This data cannot be made public, and consequently the code and data for these figures is not provided in this repository.

The code used to generate all other figures can be found within the `PaperFigures` directory. All other directories contain modeling results read in by this code.
