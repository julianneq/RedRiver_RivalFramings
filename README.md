# RedRiver_RivalFramings

This repository contains the code and results used to generate Figures 2-8 and S1-S2 of the following paper:

Quinn, J.D., Reed, P.M., Giuliani, M., and Castelletti, A. (2017). Rival framings: a framework for discovering how problem formulation uncertainties shape risk management tradeoffs in water resources systems. *Water Resources Research*, *53*(8), 7208-7233. doi: [10.1002/2017WR020524](https://doi.org/10.1002/2017WR020524)

Generating Figures 1 and S3-S5 requires reading in governmental data on demand and streamflow in the basin. This data cannot be made public, and consequently the code and data for these figures is not provided in this repository. The code for the synthetic streamflow generator is available in the following repository, but using data for the Susquehanna River Basin: https://github.com/julianneq/Kirsch-Nowak_Streamflow_Generator

The code used to generate all other figures can be found within the `PaperFigures` directory. All other directories contain modeling results read in by this code. The data for Figures 6 and 7 is too large to share over Github, but can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SPYFxoPb9omeZ6kZDNMmOCHGj7ujUPpn). Pasting the files within `RedRiver_RivalFramings/WC/simulations` and `RedRival_RivalFramings/WP1/simulations` of that Google Drive folder to the corresponding folders of this repository will enable Figures 6 and 7 to be plotted.
